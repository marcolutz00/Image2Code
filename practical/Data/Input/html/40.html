<p>According to a source at the self-ptoclaimed Donetsk republic's defense ministry,
the Ukrainian army has shelled the territory of the DPR along the line of contact
327 times over the past 24 hours,  It was reported by the local Donetsk News

<p>"Over the past 24 hours the Ukrainian army has shelled the republic's territory
327 times. The situation in the DPR remains tense," the source said.
<p>The DPR ministry added that the Ukrainian army had launched 123 82 mm and
120 mm mortar shells at the republic's populated localities and had also used
infantry combat vehicles, various types of grenade launchers and small arms.
<p>According to the ministry, the villages of Zaitsevo and Shirokaya Balka near
Gorlovka; Vesyoloye, Vasilyevka and Spartak to the north of Donetsk, the
outskirts of Donetsk airport and the Volvo-Center in the northern part of Donetsk
as well as the Kominternovo and Bezymennoye villages in the south of the DPR
