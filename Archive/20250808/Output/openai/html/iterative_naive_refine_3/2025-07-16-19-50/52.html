            <p>
                She looked at the man walking along the <input aria-label="sidewalk" type="text"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live 
                <input aria-label="any of those houses" type="text"> any of those houses. She had seen this <input aria-label="before" type="text"> several times before. He 
                looked like a criminal. <input aria-label="She knew" type="text"> knew not to judge a book by its <input aria-label="cover" type="text">, but this man 
                was no good. She drove <input aria-label="behind" type="text"> him. He looked at her car as she <input aria-label="drove" type="text"> by. She 
                continued driving. She watched him in <input aria-label="her" type="text"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner 
                <input aria-label="and" type="text"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input aria-label="the" type="text"> direction. Suddenly, 
                he turned left up a driveway. <input aria-label="A red" type="text"> SUV was parked in the driveway right 
                <input aria-label="next" type="text"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input aria-label="to" type="text"> the driver's door and put his 
                hand on <input aria-label="the" type="text"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input aria-label="walking" type="text"> in her 
                direction. What was that all about, <input aria-label="she" type="text"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested 
                <input aria-label="the" type="text"> door to see if it was locked. He <input aria-label="is" type="text"> a criminal, she thought. That's what 
                he does. <input aria-label="He" type="text"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input aria-label="to" type="text"> break 
                into. She called the police. She described <input aria-label="him" type="text">. The officer said he knew who the man 
                <input aria-label="was" type="text">. Residents called two or three times a week <input aria-label="to" type="text"> report him walking by. But 
                the police couldn't <input aria-label="arrest" type="text"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input aria-label="him" type="text"> with 
                stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input aria-label="car" type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked," she 
                <input aria-label="said" type="text">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input aria-label="the" type="text"> law. If you see him 
                actually steal something, <input aria-label="give" type="text"> us a call."
