            <h1>No Jackpot After all for German Lottery Player</h1>
            <p>A lottery player from MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany, had his hopes raised for nothing 
            last week when a German TV station broadcast the wrong numbers and caused to 
            believe he'd snagged a big win when he had not.</p>

            <p>When Franz Engelen, 58, tuned into ZDF on Wednesday, November 19, the onscreen 
            numbers were a perfect match for the six numbers chosen by his lottery syndicate so 
            he thought they'd won the jackpot. His share of the money would have been 
            â¬950,000.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately for Engelen, ZDF had broadcast the previous week's numbers by 
            mistake so his celebrations were all for naught.</p>

            <p>Speaking to the German tabloid Bild, Engelen said: "I was on the go; I looked quickly 
            at the draw, wrote down the numbers and turned off the TV. When I compared the 
            numbers with a lottery ticket and saw that six match I could not believe my luck."</p>

            <p>Totally fooled by the televised numbers, Engelen and his wife never thought to 
            contact the lottery to ask for confirmation. They began making plans instead and 
            were even considering buying their daughter a condo.</p>

            <p>Engelen learned the unfortunate truth the following morning when fellow syndicate 
            member Tipper Reinhard Coenen, 52, told him they'd won not a cent.</p>

            <p> 
            "I knew that we had not won,â Coenen said, recalling he had seen the numbers on 
            teletext and they were not the same as those broadcast by ZDF.</p>

            <p>âBut Franz felt until the next morning that we were victorious. When he learned it 
            from me, he was devastated,â Coenen added.</p>
