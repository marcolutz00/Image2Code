            </div>
            <p>Iâve added a script, <a href="#">export_google_site_news</a>, to my catchall repository on github.</p>
            <p>For example, to download the news stories at
                https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements, you would run</p>
            <pre>
export_google_site_news https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www announcements
            </pre>
            <h2>The backstory</h2>
            <p>When Free It Athens moved our website from Google Sites to Drupal, we started from scratch rather than
                importing our old content. I realized on Wednesday that the news posts on the site were interesting
                historical information, yet Iâd never archived them.</p>
            <p>First, I tried a recursive wget.</p>
            <pre>
wget -r --no-parent --no-clobber ""
            </pre>
            <p>This failed to work because Google pointlessly used javascript rather than anchor tags to link between the
                news listing pages.</p>
            <p>Next I found and tried to use the google-sites-export tool from Googleâs Data Liberation Team, but I was
                never able to authenticate succesfully from it.</p>
            <p>At this point I was worried Iâd need to use a tool like Selenium to run the javascript, but then I realized
                the news listing pages took a single paramater to determine how far along in the pagination they were. It
                wouldnât take more than a C-style for loop to download them all.</p>
            <pre>
for i in $(seq 0 10 120); do
  wget ""   "-Onews.$i"
done
            </pre>
            <p>After doing that, I looked at the first one and determined a pattern that would match the relative URLs of
                individual news stories. I then extracted all the URLs.</p>
            <pre>
grep -E -h -o '/a/freeitathens.org/foo/news/[a-z0-9\-_]+' news.* | sort -u > news_links
            </pre>
            <p>Once I had the list of URLs, it was simple to have wget download them all.</p>
            <pre>
wget -i news_links -B https://sites.google.com
            </pre>
            <p>Since I didnât find any other guides to doing this, I decided to flesh out what Iâd done into a simple tool
                and write about it here.</p>
