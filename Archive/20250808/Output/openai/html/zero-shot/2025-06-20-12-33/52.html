            <p>123. A Thief on the Sidewalk</p>
            <p>She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live
            <input type="text"> any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text"> several times before. He
            looked like a criminal. <input type="text"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text">, but this man
            was no good. She drove <input type="text"> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text"> by. She
            continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner
            <input type="text"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text"> direction. Suddenly,
            he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right
            <input type="text"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text"> the driver's door and put his
            hand on <input type="text"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text"> in her
            direction. What was that all about, <input type="text"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested
            <input type="text"> door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text"> a criminal, she thought. That's what
            he does. <input type="text"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text"> break
            into. She called the police. She described <input type="text">. The officer said he knew who the man
            <input type="text">. Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text"> report him walking by. But
            the police couldn't <input type="text"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text"> with
            stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked," she
            <input type="text">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input type="text"> law. If you see him
            actually steal something, <input type="text"> us a call."
