            123. A Thief on the Sidewalk

            <p>She looked at the man walking along the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> next to the nice houses. He didnât live <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20"> any of those houses. She had seen this <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="70" height="20"> several times before. He looked like a criminal. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="55" height="20"> knew not to judge a book by its <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="70" height="20">, but this man was no good. She drove <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="40" height="20"> him. He looked at her car as she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> by. She continued driving. She watched him in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="55" height="20"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="65" height="20"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="65" height="20"> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="40" height="20"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="80" height="20"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="80" height="20"> the driverâs door and put his hand on <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> in her direction. What was that all about, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="50" height="20"> door to see if it was locked. He <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="100" height="20"> a criminal, she thought. That's what he does. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="70" height="20"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20"> break into. She called the police. She described <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20">. The officer said he knew who the man <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20">. Residents called two or three times a week <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="80" height="20"> report him walking by. But the police couldnât <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20"> him for walking around. They had to catch <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="100" height="20"> with stolen goods. âBut he was testing that <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20"> door to see if it was unlocked,â she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="60" height="20">. âIâm sorry,â said the officer. âThatâs not against <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="120" height="20"> law. If you see him actually steal something, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="image" width="40" height="20"> us a call.â</p>
