            <div class="text">
                <p>The Round Lake Area Exchange Club Hometown Hero Committee is honored to announce U.S. Marine Lance
                    Corporal Alejandro Macias as the May hero. This month's sponsor is Collision Solution located in
                    Hainesville.</p>
                <p>Macias was registered at the Clubs site, <a href="#">www.rlaexchange.org/hero</a>, by his very proud
                    mother, Victoria L. Macias. The May hero, a Round Lake Park resident, graduated in 2010 from Round
                    Lake Senior High School.</p>
                <p>"Alejandro is our ninth hero being honored and we along with his family are in awe of his service to
                    country and joining during the time of war." shared Sherry Ridge, the Hometown Hero Project Chair.
                    Macias is currently in Jacksonville, NC. He just graduated from V-22 Airframes Mechanics School. "I
                    always get chills and tears of pride when I speak with the family members of our heroes" said Ridge.
                    His mother also shared that he earned an expert rifleman award.</p>
                <p>The Lance Corporalâs "Hanging with the Heroes" care package will be filled with chips, fruit, lots of
                    chocolate along with a personalized "Hanging with the Heroes" t-shirt and letters from Round Lake
                    Area School District 116 students. A requested item of a "Black Chicago skyline baseball cap" has
                    been made, Ridge is working on finding this cap.</p>
                <p>The Club will present a plaque on behalf of the May Hometown Hero to his family at their meeting on
                    May 25. The meeting is held at Panera Bread in Round Lake Beach, 7:30 a.m.</p>
                <p>Any and all military personnel serving overseas or in the USA from any of the Round Lake Areas,
                    Hainesville, Fox Lake or Ingleside qualify for the program. Five minutes will get them registered.
                    If you have a neighbor, family member, friend, employee, employer, etc. serving in the military
                    please register them by going to <a href="#">www.rlaexchange.org/hero</a>. We look forward to
                    announcing the June Hometown Hero. For more information visit the web site or you can contact Sherry
                    Ridge at 847-740-2379.</p>
