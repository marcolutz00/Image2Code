        <h1>Rome to Regain Control of the World</h1>
        <h2>"The Struggle for World Dominion"</h2>
        <div class="text">A rather thick book was published in 1990 by Vatican insider Malachi Martin. Martin has a lengthy list of qualifications. On the back of mother of his books,<br>we read the following accolade:</div>
        <div class="quote">âMalachi Martin served three popes as diplomat and spy, speaks seventeen languages, is a renowned Biblical scholar and a professor
            <br>at Rome's Pontifical Biblical Institute. He helped translate the Dead Sea Scrolls.âDecline and Fall of the Roman Church.
        </div>
        <p>Know any other churches engaged in espionage? Would it not be better for Roman Catholic politicians if the Vatican never engaged in espionage?</p>
        <p>The lengthy book we want to draw attention to by Martin is entitled The Keys of This Blood: The Struggle for World Dominion Between Pope John Paul,
            <br>Mikhail Gorbachev &amp; the Capitalist West (bold added). Incredible, isn't it? The title on the cover boldly proclaims that John Paul wants to take over the
            <br>world, and the massive contents purportedly lays out his plans for accomplishing this.</p>
        <p>The cover of Martin's book calls John Paul's endeavors "the struggle for world dominion." Ellen White called the papacy's endeavors "a fierce and
            <br>determined conflict to regain control of the world."
        </p>
        <p>But Ellen White's prediction is not just that the papacy would regain its power, but that it would commence again to persecute. Consider the following extract
            <br>from The Keys of This Blood:
        </p>
        <p>In [the] eyes of groups like "Adventists, Baptists and Evangelicals sects", their regard and respect for democratic principles impose upon
            <br>them the obligationâthe religious, as well as the civil and political obligationâto defend every person's right to be wrong. Every person
            <br>must have the right not only to believe in Hell of the Damned and Heaven of the Saved. Every person must literally be assured the right to
            <br>choose Hell over Heaven. That obligation carried to that extreme not only sets the Minimalists apart from John Paul; it sets them against
            <br>him as well.
        </p>
        <p>It sets them apart from the Holy Father, because democratic principles can never take precedence over divine revelation. No one can be
            <br>forced to believe in Heaven or Hell, or to choose the one over the other. Nevertheless, it is axiomatic for John Paul that no one has the right
            <br>âdemocratic or otherwiseâto a moral wrong. . . .âp. 287.
        </p>
        <p>Martin thus calls freedom of conscience an extreme, and says that groups that advocate such a freedom are "against" John Paul. In other words, Martin
            <br>claims that, similar to the popes of yesteryear, today's papacy still does not believe in freedom of conscience, and would not allow such a freedom to be a
            <br>part of the new world order it seeks to create.
        </p>
        <p>Who defines a "moral wrong"? Rome answers, "The papacy." Now if no man has a right to commit a moral wrong, and if the papacy is the one that defines
            <br>what is and isn't a moral wrong, then is there anything at all that might prevent a return of persecution if the papacy regains its lost supremacy?
