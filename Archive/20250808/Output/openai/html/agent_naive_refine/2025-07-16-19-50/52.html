            <p>
                She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text" aria-label="sidewalk"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live 
                <input type="text" aria-label="in any house"> any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text" aria-label="man"> several times before. He 
                looked like a criminal. <input type="text" aria-label="She"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text" aria-label="cover">, but this man 
                was no good. She drove <input type="text" aria-label="past him"> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text" aria-label="passed"> by. She 
                continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text" aria-label="her"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner 
                <input type="text" aria-label="and"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text" aria-label="the"> direction. Suddenly, 
                he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text" aria-label="A"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right 
                <input type="text" aria-label="next"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text" aria-label="to"> the driver's door and put his 
                hand on <input type="text" aria-label="the"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text" aria-label="walking"> in her 
                direction. What was that all about, <input type="text" aria-label="she"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested 
                <input type="text" aria-label="the"> door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text" aria-label="is"> a criminal, she thought. That's what 
                he does. <input type="text" aria-label="He"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text" aria-label="to"> break 
                into. She called the police. She described <input type="text" aria-label="the man">. The officer said he knew who the man 
                <input type="text" aria-label="was">. Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text" aria-label="to"> report him walking by. But 
                the police couldn't <input type="text" aria-label="arrest"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text" aria-label="him"> with 
                stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input type="text" aria-label="car"> door to see if it was unlocked," she 
                <input type="text" aria-label="said">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input type="text" aria-label="the"> law. If you see him 
                actually steal something, <input type="text" aria-label="give"> us a call."
