    How to Upload Videos to YouTube if Access to Website is Blocked
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p><em>R</em>ichard, who works for a large Fortune 100 company, <a href="#" class="link">recently wrote on Facebook</a> that he cannot upload screencast video clips to YouTube since the company he works for has blocked access to YouTube and other video sharing websites though the firewall.</p>
    <p>One of the available options is to use your <a href="#" class="link">mobile phone</a> for uploading videos on YouTube - just create a mobile profile on YouTube from a computer outside the organization's firewall and then email the video to YouTube as an MMS message.</p>
    <p>Related: <a href="#" class="link">How to Access Blocked Websites</a></p>
    <p>The second more versatile option is the one-to-many <a href="#" class="link">Hey!Spread</a> - this is an online service to help you upload a video clip to multiple video sharing websites in one go.</p>
    <p>You upload the video to Hey!Spread servers and they in turn upload it to the various other video sites including YouTube, MySpace, PhotoBucket, MetaCafe, Google, Yahoo! video, DailyMotion, etc.</p>
    <p>Chances are high that access to Hey!Spread is open in your company - they'll send you an email confirmation as soon as your video is uploaded successfully to the different sites.</p>
