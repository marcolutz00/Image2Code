    <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:3em;">PILLARS</h1>
    <p>The CREATE H2O program includes five pillars offering in-depth training.</p>
    <p>Within each of these pillars, there are many options from which students may choose. For each student accepted into the program, the pillar
    requirements are tailored to the student's educational background, degree course requirements, and the focus area the student wishes to
    pursue in First Nations water and sanitation security.</p>
    <p>Each student accepted into the program is assigned two professors who will act as mentors. Along with the CREATE H2O program co-
    ordinator, these professors will assist students in designing the pillar structure and activities that best match each student's career path and
    goals.</p>
    <p>Students accepted into the program will receive financial support consisting of a <a href="#" style="color:#007bff; !important">stipend</a> and <a href="#" style="color:#007bff; !important">travel</a> awards.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">DESIGNING YOUR PROGRAM TO OBTAIN A CO-CURRICULAR RECORD IN FIRST NATIONS
    WATER AND SANITATION SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Undergraduate students must choose between a relevant research-based project (Pillar 1) and a professional work term (Pillar 5). In addition,
    undergraduate students are required to complete 8 portfolio units across at least two of the other three program pillars before you graduate.</p>

    <h2>AN EXAMPLE OF AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLED IN THE CREATE H2O PROGRAM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Summer research project under the leadership of professors at the University of Manitoba or Trent University (pillar 1)</li>
        <li>One three-credit-hour science course from approved list (pillar 2): 3 units</li>
        <li>One non-science course from approved list (pillar 3): 3 units</li>
        <li>Present H2O research at Indigenous knowledge conference (pillar 3): 1 unit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AN EXAMPLE OF A GRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLED IN THE CREATE H2O PROGRAM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Research thesis under the leadership of professors at the University of Manitoba or Trent University</li>
        <li>Two science courses from approved list (pillar 2): 3X2 = 6 units</li>
        <li>One non-science course from approved list (pillar 3): 3 units</li>
        <li>Present H2O research at conference (pillar 2 or 3): 1 unit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(See this student's <a href="#" style="color:#007bff; !important">sample spreadsheet</a> showing calculation of pillar units and approval signature slots.)</p>
    <p>Note that these are general examples. Each student's background will be assessed by supervisors at the start of the program to design a specific set of unit requirements that will complement the student's strengths.</p>
