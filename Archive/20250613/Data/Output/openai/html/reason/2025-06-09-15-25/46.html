        <h2>"Make them holy through your word: your teaching is true." John 17:17</h2>
        <p>
            When the good news is "not just words, but true power," it is "in the Holy Spirit," meaning, with what the Holy Spirit teaches and shows. 
            This coming "in the Holy Spirit" lets truth really change hearts. You might ask, What does 'change hearts' mean? 
            It means sharing holy feelings, strong wants for God, and loving thoughts; 
            it means filling the soul with a sweet desire for God, which brings life and peace. 
            If we're God's people, he chose us to be in Christ "before the world was made, to be holy and perfect in his love." 
            If he tests us now, it is "for our good, so we can share in his holiness" (Heb. 12:10). 
            This pure heart and focus on God is what I mean by truth changing hearts. 
            Has truth ever touched your heart like this? 
            Have you wanted to leave church, go home, kneel down, and connect with God the Father and Jesus? 
            And did it feel good when you did? 
            Or, when alone reading, thinking, or praying, did God's word fill you with a sweet, fresh feeling, so much that the room felt holy? 
            I recall when God showed me his Son in my sick room long ago; 
            I was afraid to leave, in case I lost the sweet, holy feelings and deep peace I felt then.
            Know for sure, you must have a pure heart and love for God to see him; 
            and know that when truth enters someone's soul, it changes them, making them ready for, 
            and giving them a taste of, the great gift that awaits God's people.
