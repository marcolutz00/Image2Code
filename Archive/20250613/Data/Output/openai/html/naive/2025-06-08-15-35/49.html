            <p>The Local Area Exchange Club Champion Selection Committee is happy to announce U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Alejandro Macias as the May honoree. The month's supporter is Collision Solution in Hainesville.</p>
            <p>Macias was nominated at the Club's website, www.rlaexchange.org/hero, by his very proud mother, Victoria L. Macias. The May winner, a Round Lake Park native, graduated in 2010 from Round Lake High School.</p>
            <p>“Alejandro is our ninth champion being recognized and we along with his family admire his service to the nation and enlisting during the time of combat.” relayed Sherry Ridge, the Champion Selection Head. Macias is now in Jacksonville, NC. He completed V-22 Airframes Mechanics School. “I feel proud when I talk with the family of our heroes” said Ridge. His mom also mentioned he received a rifleman award.</p>
            <p>The Lance Corporal's "Greetings to the Champions" care package will be stocked with snacks, fruit, chocolate and a special "Greetings to the Champions" t-shirt and notes from Local Area School District 116 children. A requested item of a "Black Chicago skyline baseball cap" has been asked for, Ridge is trying to find this cap.</p>
            <p>The Club will hand out a award on behalf of the May Local Champion to the family at the meeting on May 25. The meeting is at Panera Bread in Round Lake Beach, 7:30 a.m.</p>
            <p>All military members overseas or in the USA from any of the Round Lake Areas, Hainesville, Fox Lake or Ingleside can join the program. Minutes will get the person registered.
