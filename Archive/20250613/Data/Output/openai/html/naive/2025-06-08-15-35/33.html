            <ul>
                <li>A blockchain node is a device that joins a blockchain network by operating the network's software, enabling it to verify transactions.</li>
                <li>Blockchain nodes typically interact with one another to confirm and validate transactions.</li>
                <li>The greater the number of nodes in a network, the more decentralized it becomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What exactly are blockchain nodes?</h2>
            <p>
                The question "what is a node in blockchain?" is best understood by picturing a blockchain network. A network requires multiple interconnected devices or computers that can write, upload, and verify the data managed by the network's software. For example, if you want to run a node for <a href="#">Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC)</a>, you can freely download and operate the Bitcoin Core software on your computer without any restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                A blockchain node is a computer or device running the network's software and interacting with other nodes to verify data added to the blockchain. Operating this software across multiple devices boosts the network's security and strengthens its decentralization.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most <a href="#">blockchain networks</a>, anyone is free to run a node; however, some networks are selective and permit only certain nodes to operate their software and take part in the network.
            </p>

            <h2>How does a blockchain node function?</h2>
            <p>
                The primary functions of a blockchain node are to broadcast and validate transactions. When a user submits a transaction, it's picked up by one node, which then shares it with all other nodes across the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                After all nodes read the transaction and confirm that the user has sufficient funds, they approve the transaction to proceed. Because every node takes part in verifying transactions, a transaction can only be canceled or denied if 51% of the nodes agree that it's invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a 51% attack is technically possible, it's difficult to carry out in a decentralized network. In such a network, numerous independent nodes operate without control by a single user or group that could manipulate or censor transactions. This means the more nodes a blockchain has, the more secure it becomes against a 51% attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a node validates new transactions, they are bundled into blocks and added to the blockchain according to the network's established rules. Once added, no node can alter the contents of any block, ensuring that the recorded data remains permanent and unchangeable.
