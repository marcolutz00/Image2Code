            <h3>123. A Crook on the Pavement</h3>
            <p>
                She glanced at the guy walking down the <input type="text"> by the fancy homes. 
                He didn't stay <input type="text"> any of those homes. 
                She had noticed this <input type="text"> several times before. 
                He looked like a thief. <input type="text"> knew not to judge a book by its 
                <input type="text">, but this guy was trouble. 
                She steered <input type="text"> him. 
                He eyed her car as she <input type="text"> by. 
                She drove onward. She kept watching him in <input type="text"> the rearview mirror. 
                She got to the junction <input type="text"> halted. 
                She still eyed him strolling in <input type="text"> direction. 
                Suddenly, he turned left up a lane. 
                <input type="text"> bright red SUV was in the driveway right <input type="text"> to the walkway. 
                She saw him go up <input type="text"> the driver's side and touched <input type="text"> handle. 
                He went to the sidewalk and carried <input type="text"> in her direction. 
                What was that all about, she <input type="text"> wondered. 
                Then she knew he had checked <input type="text"> the door to see if it was open. 
                He's <input type="text"> a crook, she thought. 
                That's his work. <input type="text"> just goes through areas searching for cars 
                <input type="text"> to rob. 
                She telephoned the police. She described <input type="text">. 
                The cop said he knew the man <input type="text">. 
                People called a couple of times a week <input type="text"> saying he was nearby. 
                But the cops couldn't <input type="text"> him just for being there. 
                They had to nab him with stolen stuff. 
                "But he tried that <input type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked," she <input type="text">. 
                "I'm sorry," the cop said. "That's not against <input type="text"> the rules. 
                If you catch him stealing, give <input type="text"> us a ring."
