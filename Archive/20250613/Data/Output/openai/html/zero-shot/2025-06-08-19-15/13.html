    <h1>Export news from google sites</h1>

    <div class="date">Apr 27, 2012</div>
    <div class="reading-time">One min of reading</div>

    <p>
        I've put online a quick code snippet, <a href="#">export_google_site_news</a>, to my main repository located on github.
    </p>

    <p>
        To illustrate, for pulling the news posts from 
        https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements, you can call:
    </p>

    <div class="code-block">
        export_google_site_news \<br>
        https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www \<br>
        announcements
    </div>

    <h2>Genesis of This</h2>

    <p>
        When Free It Athens migrated their site away from Google Sites over to Drupal, they went
        fresh, losing all the previous content. I just realized that news data on the old site was valuable
        historical content, and I hadn't saved it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, I gave recursive wget a whirl.
    </p>

    <div class="code-block">
        wget -r --no-parent --no-clobber \<br>
        ""
    </div>

    <p>
        This just failed as Google made the mistake of using javascript rather than anchor tags to
        connect news pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hunted down and tried Google's own google-sites-export from their Data Liberation Team, but
        could never authenticate correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        I then feared I’d need Selenium to trigger the javascript, but then realized that the news pages
        took a single parameter to determine which paginated results to display. Looping would get
        them all.
    </p>

    <div class="code-block">
        for i in $(seq 0 10 120); do<br>
        wget "" \<br>
        "-Onews.$i"<br>
        done
    </div>

    <p>
        After getting the first one, I saw a pattern to match each news stories' relative paths. Then
        extracted out all those paths.
    </p>

    <div class="code-block">
        grep -E -h -o "/a/freeitathens.org/foo/news/[a-z0-9\-]+/" news.* |<br>
        sort -u > news_links
    </div>

    <p>
        Once I had all the paths, it was easy to get wget to fetch them all.
    </p>

    <div class="code-block">
        wget -i news_links -B https://sites.google.com
    </div>

    <p>
        Since I found zero guides online, I tried writing up a simple script from the above, and am
        detailing it here.
