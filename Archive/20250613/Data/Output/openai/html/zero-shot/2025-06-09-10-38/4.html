        <div class="content">
            <p>The Develop H2O project features five elements for extensive learning.</p>
            <p>In each of these elements, there are a multitude of avenues for pupils to choose from. For all pupils participating in the project, the element criteria are customized based on the pupil’s learning history, academic degree standards, and the concentration area the pupil intends to follow in National waters provision and environmental protection.</p>
            <p>Every pupil participating in the project will be appointed two lecturers who will function as advisors. Alongside the Develop H2O project leader, these lecturers will guide pupils in developing the element structure and actions that align to each pupil’s professional path and aims.</p>
            <p>Pupils taking part in the project will be given monetary compensation including a <a href="#">payment</a> and <a href="#">journeying</a> grants.</p>
            
            <h2>Planning Your Project to Achieve an Extra-Curricular Entry in National Waters Provision and Environmental Protection</h2>
            <p>Students must select between a related study-driven task (Element 1) and a professional training stint (Element 5). In addition, students have to achieve 8 portfolio sections across at least two of the other three project elements before your graduation.</p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Summer study task run by lecturers at the University of Manitoba or Trent University (element 1)</li>
                <li>One 3 credit unit science seminar from provided list (element 2): 3 units</li>
                <li>One non-science seminar from provided list (element 3): 3 units</li>
                <li>Deliver H2O study at Indigenous understanding meeting (element 3): 1 unit</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Scenario of A Postgraduate Student Participating in the Develop H2O Project</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Study thesis run by lecturers at the University of Manitoba or Trent University</li>
                <li>Two science seminars from provided list (element 2): 3x2 = 6 units</li>
                <li>One non-science seminar from provided list (element 3): 3 units</li>
                <li>Deliver H2O study at meeting (element 2 or 3): 1 unit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>(Consider this student’s <em>example file</em> demonstrating element unit measure and agreement permission sections.)</p>
            <p>Consider that these are broad scenarios. Every student’s foundation will be examined by supervisors at the beginning of the project to create a certain set of unit criteria that matches the student’s capabilities.</p>
