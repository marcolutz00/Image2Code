        <h1>Rome to Take Over Entire Earth</h1>
        <h2>"The War for Earth's Kingdom"</h2>
        <p>In '90 a profound volume appeared, authored by the Vatican's inside person, Malachi Martin. Martin had very
            remarkable qualifications. On the cover of his other book, the following description showed up:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Malachi Martin-- eminent diplomat, spy of three popes, a master of seventeen languages, an expert on the
            Bible and instructor at Rome's BiblicA Academy. He participated in translation of the Dead Sea
            Scrolls--<em>Breakdown of the Catholic Society</em>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>What other group takes part in undercover activity? Wouldn't that be best for Catholic leaders if the Vatican
            never involved itself in spying?</p>
        <p>The long book that draws concern by Martin is titled <cite>The Keys of This Blood: The War for Earth's Kingdom
                Between Pope John Paul, Mikhail Gorbachev & the Capitalist West</cite> (bold type). Amazing, huh? The
            front boldly shares John Paul will dominate globally, the content purports his detailed schemers to
            fulfill this.</p>
        <p>The cover of Martin's volume refers to John Paul's ventures "the war for earthly dominion." E. White used to
            call the papacy's initiatives "a deep and active struggle to seize influence worldwide." A sort of overlap,
            right?</p>
        <p>Yet E. White's foretelling doesn't end with just that the papacy would grow stronger, but it will trigger once
            more to oppress. Observe the quoted material taken from <em>The Keys of This Blood</em>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In [the] viewpoints of "[Seventh-Day Adventists, Baptists and religious groups]", the value & honor for
                democratic thinking places on them responsibility--the religious, also the civic and the legal
                obligation--to shield people's right to disagree. Every person should possess the right to not just
                accept the idea of hell for the wicked and heaven for the chosen. Every person will get the right to
                pick hell instead of heaven. This responsibility sent far enough puts Minor people separate from John
                Paul; it sets one against the Holy See, too.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That creates separation from the Holy See, simply because democratic thinking shall never dominate holy
            writing. No individual is ever compelled to be convinced about heaven or hell, nor select the specific one.
            Still, it is true for John Paul no individual holds the right--democratic and otherwise--to a moral
            transgression; . . . --p. 287.
        </p>
        <p>Martin says freedom as a choice is excessive, and states groups that suggest a choice are "against" John Paul.
            Stated differently, Martin claims that, similar to the former popes, right now the papacy does not consider
            freedom as a choice, and might not grant that as a role in the future world structure they seek.</p>
        <p>Who has authority to identify "wrong behaviors"? Rome has the answer: "The pope." Now, since a person
            shouldn't commit wrong actions, if the Pope figures what's right and wrong, would just anything block a
            rebirth of the persecution if the Papal Leaders claim the power that was lost?</p>
