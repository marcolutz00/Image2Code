            <h1>Rome to Take Over Entire Earth</h1>
            <h2>"The War for Earth's Kingdom"</h2>
            <p>In '90 a profound volume appeared, authored by the Vatican's inside person, Malachi Martin. Martin had very remarkable
                qualifications. On the cover of his other book, the following description showed up:</p>
            <p class="yellow-bg">"Malachi Martin was a diplomat, spy of three popes, a master of seventeen languages, an expert on the Bible and
                instructor at Rome's Biblical Academy. He participated in translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
                -Breakdown of the Catholic Society.</p>
            <p>What other group takes part in undercover activity? Wouldn't that be best for Catholic leaders if the Vatican never
                involved itself in spying?</p>
            <p>The long book that draws concern by Martin is titled <span class="bold">The Keys of This Blood: The War for Earth's Kingdom
                    Between Pope John Paul, Mikhail Gorbachev & the Capitalist West</span> (bold type). Amazing, huh? The front boldly
                shares John Paul will dominate globally, the content purports his detailed schemes to fulfill this.</p>
            <p>The cover of Martin's volume refers to John Paul's ventures "the war for earthly dominion." E. White used to call the
                papacy's initiatives "a deep and active struggle to seize influence worldwide." A sort of overlap, right?</p>
            <p>Yet E. White's foretelling doesn't end with just that the papacy would grow stronger, but it will trigger once more to
                oppress. Observe the quoted material taken from <span class="bold">The Keys of This Blood</span>:</p>
            <p class="yellow-bg">In [the] viewpoints [of "Seventh-Day Adventists, Baptists and religious groups"], the value & honor for democratic
                thinking places on them responsibility-the religious, also the civic and the legal obligation-to shield people's right
                to disagree. Every person should possess the right to not just accept the idea of hell for the wicked and heaven for the
                chosen. Every person will get the right to pick hell instead of heaven. This responsibility sent far enough puts Minor
                people separate from John Paul; it sets one against the Holy See, too.</p>
            <p>That creates separation from the Holy See, simply because democratic thinking shall never dominate holy writing. No
                individual is ever compelled to be convinced about heaven or hell, nor select the specific one. Still, it is true for
                John Paul no individual holds the right-democratic and otherwise-to a moral transgression;....-p. 287.</p>
            <p>Martin says freedom as a choice is excessive, and states groups that suggest a choice are "against" John Paul. Stated
                differently, Martin claims that, similar to the former popes, right now the papacy does not consider freedom as a choice,
                and might not grant that as a role in the future world structure they seek.</p>
            <p>Who has authority to identify "wrong behaviors"? Rome has the answer: "The pope." Now, since a person shouldn't commit
                wrong actions, if the Pope figures what's right and wrong, would just anything block a rebirth of the persecution if the
                Papal Leaders claim the power that was lost?</p>
