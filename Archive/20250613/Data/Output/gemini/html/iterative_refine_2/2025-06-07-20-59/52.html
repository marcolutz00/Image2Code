    <h1>123. A Crook on the Pavement</h1>
    <p>
        She glanced at the guy walking down the <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> by the fancy homes. He didn't stay <input type="text" style="width: 50px;"> any of those homes. She had noticed this <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> several times before. He looked like a thief. <input type="text" style="width: 70px;"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text" style="width: 60px;"> , but this guy was trouble. She steered <input type="text" style="width: 50px;"> him. He eyed her car as she <input type="text" style="width: 50px;"> by. She drove onward. She kept watching him in <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> the rearview mirror. She got to the junction <input type="text" style="width: 50px;"> halted. She still eyed him strolling in <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a lane.
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> bright red SUV was in the driveway right <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> to the walkway. She saw him go up <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> the driver's side and touched <input type="text" style="width: 50px;"> handle. He went to the sidewalk and carried <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> in her direction. What was that all about, she <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> wondered. Then she knew he had checked
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> the door to see if it was open. He's <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> a crook, she thought. That's his work.
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> just goes through areas searching for cars <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> to rob. She telephoned the police. She described
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> The cop said he knew the man <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> . People called a couple of times a week
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> saying he was nearby. But the cops couldn't <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> him just for being there. They had to nab
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> him with stolen stuff. "But he tried that <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> door to see if it was unlocked," she
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> "I'm sorry," the cop said. "That's not against <input type="text" style="width: 80px;"> the rules. If you catch him stealing, give
        <input type="text" style="width: 100px;"> us a ring."
