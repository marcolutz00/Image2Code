        <h1>Rome to Take Over Entire Earth</h1>
        <h2>"The War for Earth's Kingdom"</h2>
        <p>In '90 a profound volume appeared, authored by the Vatican's inside person, Malachi Martin. Martin had very remarkable
            qualifications. On the cover of his other book, the following description showed up:</p>
        <p class="highlight">"Malachi Martin was a diplomat, spy of three popes, a master of seventeen languages, an expert on the Bible and
            instructor at Rome's Biblical Academy. He participated in translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls.-Breakdown of the
            Catholic Society.</p>
        <p>What other group takes part in undercover activity? Wouldn't that be best for Catholic leaders if the Vatican never
            involved itself in spying?</p>
        <p>The long book that draws concern by Martin is titled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Keys of This Blood: The War for Earth's
                Kingdom Between Pope John Paul, Mikhail
                Gorbachev & the Capitalist West</span> (bold type). Amazing, huh? The front boldly shares John Paul will dominate globally, the
            content purports his detailed schemes to fulfill this.</p>
        <p>The cover of Martin's volume refers to John Paul's ventures "the war for earthly dominion." E. White used to call the
            papacy's initiatives "a deep and active struggle to seize influence worldwide." A sort of overlap, right?</p>
        <p>Yet E. White's foretelling doesn't end with just that the papacy would grow stronger, but it will trigger once more to
            oppress. Observe the quoted material taken from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Keys of This Blood</span>:</p>
        <p class="highlight">In [the] viewpoints [of "Seventh-Day Adventists, Baptists and religious groups"], the value & honor for democratic
            thinking places on them responsibility-the religious, also the civic and the legal obligation-to shield people's right to
            disagree. Every person should possess the right to not just accept the idea of hell for the wicked and heaven for the
            chosen. Every person will get the right to pick hell instead of heaven. This responsibility sent far enough puts Minor people
            separate from John Paul; it sets one against the Holy See, too.</p>
        <p>That creates separation from the Holy See, simply because democratic thinking shall never dominate holy writing. No
            individual is ever compelled to be convinced about heaven or hell, nor select the specific one. Still, it is true for John
            Paul no individual holds the right-democratic and otherwise-to a moral transgression;....-p. 287.</p>
        <p>Martin says freedom as a choice is excessive, and states groups that suggest a choice are "against" John Paul. Stated
            differently, Martin claims that, similar to the former popes, right now the papacy does not consider freedom as a choice, and
            might not grant that as a role in the future world structure they seek.</p>
        <p>Who has authority to identify "wrong behaviors"? Rome has the answer: "The pope." Now, since a person shouldn't commit wrong
            actions, if the Pope figures what's right and wrong, would just anything block a rebirth of the persecution if the Papal
            Leaders claim the power that was lost?</p>
