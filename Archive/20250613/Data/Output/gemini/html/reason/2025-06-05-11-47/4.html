      <h1>KEY COMPONENTS</h1>
      <p>The Develop H2O project features five elements for extensive learning.</p>
      <p>In each of these elements, there are a multitude of avenues for pupils to choose from. For all pupils participating in the project, the element
      criteria are customized based on the pupil's learning history, academic degree standards, and the concentration area the pupil intends to follow
      in National waters provision and environmental protection.</p>
      <p>Every pupil participating in the project will be appointed two lecturers who will function as advisors. Alongside the Develop H2O project leader,
      these lecturers will guide pupils in developing the element structure and actions that align to each pupil's professional path and aims.</p>
      <p>Pupils taking part in the project will be given monetary compensation including a <a href="#">payment</a> and <a href="#">journeying</a> grants.</p>

      <p>Students must select between a related study-driven task (Element 1) and a professional training stint (Element 5). In addition, students have
      to achieve 8 portfolio sections across at least two of the other three project elements before your graduation.</p>
