                    <h1>May 2011 Hero Ã¢ÂÂ U.S. Marine LCpl Alejandro Macias</h1>
                    <p>by john | May 1, 2011 | Club News</p>

                    <p>The Round Lake Area Exchange Club Hometown Hero Committee is honored to announce U.S. Marine Lance
                        Corporal
                        Alejandro Macias as the May hero. This month's sponsor is Collision Solution located in
                        Hainesville.</p>

                    <p>Macias was registered at the Clubs site, www.rlaexchange.org/hero, by his very proud mother, Victoria
                        L. Macias.
                        The May
                        hero, a Round Lake Park resident, graduated in 2010 from Round Lake Senior High School.</p>

                    <p>"Alejandro is our ninth hero being honored and we along with his family are in awe of his service to
                        country
                        and joining
                        during
                        the time of war." shared Sherry Ridge, the Hometown Hero Project Chair. Macias is currently in
                        Jacksonville, NC. He just
                        graduated from V-22 Airframes Mechanics School. "I always get chills and tears of pride when I speak
                        with
                        the family
                        members of our heroes" said Ridge. His mother also shared that he earned an expert rifleman award.</p>

                    <p>The Lance Corporal's "Hanging with the Heroes" care package will be filled with chips, fruit, lots of
                        chocolate
                        along with a personalized "Hanging with the Heroes" t-
                        shirt and letters from Round Lake Area School District 116 students. A requested item of a "Black
                        Chicago
                        skyline baseball cap" has been made, Ridge is working on
                        finding this cap.</p>

                    <p>The Club will present a plaque on behalf of the May Hometown Hero to his family at their meeting on May
                        25.
