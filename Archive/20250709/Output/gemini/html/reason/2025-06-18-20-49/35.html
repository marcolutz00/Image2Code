        <p>Mountain bike trail development organization ADSVMQ officially transfers mtn bike trail development activities to VÃ©lo QuÃ©bec</p>
        <p>The news is that the QuÃ©bec mountain bike trail development organization ADSVMQ today officially transfers their mountain bike trail development responsibility to VÃ©lo QuÃ©bec.</p>
        <p>QuÃ©bec is a goldmine of mountain bike tourism waiting for the trails to be built. The recent work of the ADSVMQ moved mountains and brought QuÃ©bec trails into the 21st century. The hope and expectation is that VÃ©lo QuÃ©bec will leverage the mountain bike tourism lever and get more regions to each develop their mountain bike trail network. With QuÃ©bec's vast size there are many regions that possess excellent mountain bike trail development potential.</p>
        <p>QuÃ©bec has the potential for lots more destinations for mountain biking. We have heard that the national parks (provincial and federal) are beginning to think about contemplating the idea that the mountain bike rider is a valid user of our parks. Please national parks: build some real mountain bike trails.</p>
        <p>Don't get the impression that QuÃ©bec has no trails. <a href="#">Click here</a> to go to the quÃ©bec mtn bike trail directory at AllezY.</p>
        <p>You can read ADSVMQ president David Lauzon's statement <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p>You can sign up to VÃ©lo QuÃ©bec's new mountain bike infolettre <a href="#">here</a>. You can also join VÃ©lo QuÃ©bec because the more members they have, the greater is their ability to push for bike development on and off the roads of Quebec.</p>
