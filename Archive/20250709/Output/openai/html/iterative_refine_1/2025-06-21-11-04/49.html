        <h1>May 2011 Hero Ã¢â¬â U.S. Marine LCpl Alejandro Macias</h1>
        <p class="meta">by John | May 1, 2011 | Club News</p>
        <p>The Round Lake Area Exchange Club Hometown Hero Committee is honored to announce U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Alejandro Macias as the May hero. This monthÃ¢â¬â¢s sponsor is Collision Solution located in Hainesville.</p>
        <p>Macias was registered at the Clubs site, www.rlaexchange.org/hero, by his very proud mother, Victoria L. Macias. The May hero, a Round Lake Park resident, graduated in 2010 from Round Lake Senior High School.</p>
        <p>Ã¢â¬ÅAlejandro is our ninth hero being honored and we along with his family are in awe of his service to country and joining during the time of war.Ã¢â¬ï¿½ shared Sherry Ridge, the Hometown Hero Project Chair. Macias is currently in Jacksonville, NC. He just graduated from V-22 Airframes Mechanics School. Ã¢â¬ÅI always get chills and tears of pride when I speak with the family members of our heroesÃ¢â¬ï¿½ said Ridge. His mother also shared that he earned an expert rifleman award.</p>
