        <h1>PILLARS</h1>
        <p>The CREATE H2O program includes five pillars offering in-depth training.</p>
        <p>Within each of these pillars, there are many options from which students may choose. For each student accepted into the program, the pillar requirements are tailored to the student's educational background, degree course requirements, and the focus area the student wishes to pursue in First Nations water and sanitation security.</p>
        <p>Each student accepted into the program is assigned two professors who will act as mentors. Along with the CREATE H2O program coordinator, these professors will assist students in designing the pillar structure and activities that best match each student's career path and goals.</p>
        <p>Students accepted into the program will receive financial support consisting of a <span class="external-links"><a href="#">stipend</a></span> and <span class="external-links"><a href="#">travel</a></span> awards.</p>

            <h2>DESIGNING YOUR PROGRAM TO OBTAIN A CO-CURRICULAR RECORD IN FIRST NATIONS WATER AND SANITATION SECURITY</h2>
            <p>Undergraduate students must choose between a relevant research-based project (Pillar 1) and a professional work term (Pillar 5). In addition, undergraduate students are required to complete 8 portfolio units across at least two of the other three program pillars before you graduate.</p>
