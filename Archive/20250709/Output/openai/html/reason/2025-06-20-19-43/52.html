            <p>123. A Thief on the Sidewalk</p>
            <p>She looked at the man walking along the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> next to the nice houses. He didn't live <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> any of those houses. She had seen this <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> several times before. He looked like a criminal. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> knew not to judge a book by its <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="">, but this man was no good. She drove <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> him. He looked at her car as she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> by. She continued driving. She watched him in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> rear view mirror. She got to the corner <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> red SUV was parked in the driveway right <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> the driver's door and put his hand on <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> in her direction. What was that all about, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> door to see if it was locked. He <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> a criminal, she thought. That's what he does. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> break into. She called the police. She described <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="">. The officer said he knew who the man <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="">. Residents called two or three times a week <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> report him walking by. But the police couldn't <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> him for walking around. They had to catch <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> with stolen goods. "But he was testing that <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> door to see if it was unlocked," she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> law. If you see him actually steal something, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=""> us a call."
