            <p>
                She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> several times before. He looked like a criminal. <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word">, but this man was no good. She drove <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> by. She continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> the driver's door and put his hand on <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> in her direction. What was that all about, <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> a criminal, she thought. That's what he does. <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> break into. She called the police. She described <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word">. The officer said he knew who the man <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word">. Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> report him walking by. But the police couldn't <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> with stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> door to see if it was unlocked," she <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> law. If you see him actually steal something, <input type="text" aria-label="Enter word"> us a call."
