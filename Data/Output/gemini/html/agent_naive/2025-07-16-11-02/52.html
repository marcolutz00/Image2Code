        She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live <input type="text"><br>
        any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text"> several times before. He <input type="text"><br>
        looked like a criminal. <input type="text"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text">, but this man <input type="text"><br>
        was no good. She drove <input type="text"> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text"> by. She <input type="text"><br>
        continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner <input type="text"><br>
        <input type="text"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text"> direction. Suddenly, <input type="text"><br>
        he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right <input type="text"><br>
        <input type="text"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text"> the driver's door and put his <input type="text"><br>
        hand on <input type="text"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text"> in her <input type="text"><br>
        direction. What was that all about, <input type="text"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested <input type="text"><br>
        <input type="text"> door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text"> a criminal, she thought. That's what <input type="text"><br>
        he does. <input type="text"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text"> break <input type="text"><br>
        into. She called the police. She described <input type="text">. The officer said he knew who the man <input type="text"><br>
        <input type="text"> Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text"> report him walking by. But <input type="text"><br>
        the police couldn't <input type="text"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text"> with <input type="text"><br>
        stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked," she <input type="text"><br>
        <input type="text"> "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input type="text"> law. If you see him <input type="text"><br>
        actually steal something, <input type="text"> us a call." <input type="text"><br><br>
