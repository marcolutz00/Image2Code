            <h1 style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center;">PILLARS</h1>

            <p>The CREATE H2O program includes five pillars offering in-depth training.</p>
            <p>Within each of these pillars, there are many options from which students may choose. For each student accepted into the program, the
                pillar
                requirements are tailored to the student's educational background, degree course requirements, and the focus area the student
                wishes to
                pursue in First Nations water and sanitation security.</p>
            <p>Each student accepted into the program is assigned two professors who will act as mentors. Along with the CREATE H2O program co-
                ordinator, these professors will assist students in designing the pillar structure and activities that best match each student's
                career path and
                goals.</p>
            <p>Students accepted into the program will receive financial support consisting of a <a href="#">stipend</a> and <a href="#">travel</a> awards.</p>

            </h1>

            <p>Undergraduate students must choose between a relevant research-based project (Pillar 1) and a professional work term (Pillar 5). In
                addition,
                undergraduate students are required to complete 8 portfolio units across at least two of the other three program pillars before
                you graduate.</p>

                <li>Two science courses from approved list (pillar 2): 3X2 = 6 units</li>

            <p>Note that these are general examples. Each student's background will be assessed by supervisors at the start of the program to
                design a specific set of unit requirements that will complement the student's strengths.</p>
