        <h1>OSCE reports highest number of ceasefire violations in Donbass since September 2015.</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Monitors from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine recorded the highest number of ceasefire violations in Ukraine's Donetsk region on Thursday since the
            ceasefire agreement of September 2015, according to a statement by Ertugrul Apakan, head of the OSCE SMM, published on the OSCE website.</p>
            <p>He stated that the parties involved in the Ukrainian conflict had created an unsustainable situation along the frontline.</p>
            <p>According to a source from the defense ministry of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic, the Ukrainian army shelled DPR-held territory along the frontline 327 times in
            the past 24 hours, the Donetsk News Agency (DNA) reported on Thursday.</p>
            <p>"In the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian army shelled the republic's territory 327 times. The situation in the DPR remains tense," the source stated.</p>
            <p>The DPR ministry added that the Ukrainian army fired 123 mortar shells, including 82 mm and 120 mm calibers, at towns within the republic, and also employed infantry
            fighting vehicles, various grenade launchers, and small arms.</p>
            <p>According to the ministry, the villages of Zaitsevo and Shirokaya Balka near Gorlovka; Vesyoloye, Vasilyevka, and Spartak north of Donetsk; the outskirts of Donetsk
            airport and the Volvo-Center in northern Donetsk; as well as the villages of Kominternovo and Bezymennoye in southern DPR, were subjected to the most intense shelling,
            involving weapons banned under the Minsk agreements.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian army strikes led to the deaths of three DPR fighters, with five others injured.</p>
