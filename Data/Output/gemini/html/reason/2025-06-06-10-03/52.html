        <h2>123. A Crook on the Pavement</h2>

        <p>She glanced at the guy walking down the <input type="text"> by the fancy homes. He didn't stay <input type="text"> any of those
        homes. She had noticed this <input type="text"> several times before. He looked like a thief. <input type="text"> knew not to judge
        a book by its <input type="text">, but this guy was trouble. She steered <input type="text"> him. He eyed her car as she <input type="text">.</p>
        
        <p><input type="text"> by. She drove onward. She kept watching him in <input type="text"> the rearview mirror. She got to the junction
        <input type="text"> halted. She still eyed him strolling in <input type="text"> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a lane.
        <input type="text"> bright red SUV was in the driveway right <input type="text"> to the walkway. She saw him go up 
        <input type="text"> the driver's side and touched <input type="text"> handle. He went to the sidewalk and carried 
        <input type="text"> in her direction. What was that all about, she <input type="text"> wondered. Then she knew he had checked 
        <input type="text"> the door to see if it was open. He's <input type="text"> a crook, she thought. That's his work.
        <input type="text"> just goes through areas searching for cars <input type="text"> to rob. She telephoned the police. She described 
        <input type="text">. The cop said he knew the man <input type="text">. People called a couple of times a week
        <input type="text"> saying he was nearby. But the cops couldn't <input type="text"> him just for being there. They had to nab
        <input type="text"> him with stolen stuff. "But he tried that <input type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked," she 
        <input type="text">. "I'm sorry," the cop said. "That's not against <input type="text"> the rules. If you catch him stealing, give
        <input type="text"> us a ring."</p>
