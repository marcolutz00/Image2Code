            <p>A lottery player from Mönchengladbach, Germany, had his hopes raised for nothing
last week when a German TV station broadcast the wrong numbers and led him to
believe he'd scored a big win-when he hadn't.</p>

<p>When Franz Engelen, 58, tuned into ZDF on Wednesday, November 19, the numbers
displayed on screen matched perfectly with the six chosen by his lottery syndicate,
and he thought they had hit the jackpot. His share would have been €950,000.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Engelen, ZDF had mistakenly aired the previous week's numbers,
turning his celebration into disappointment.</p>

<p>Speaking to the German tabloid <em>Bild</em>, Engelen said: "I was on the go; I looked quickly
at the draw, wrote down the numbers, and turned off the TV. When I compared the
numbers with a lottery ticket and saw that six matched, I couldn't believe my luck."</p>

<p>Misled by the broadcast, Engelen and his wife didn't contact the lottery for
confirmation. Instead, they began making plans and were even considering buying
their daughter a condo.</p>

<p>Engelen found out the truth the next morning when fellow syndicate member Tipper
Reinhard Coenen, 52, told him they hadn't won a cent.</p>

<p>"I knew we hadn't won," Coenen said, explaining that he had seen the correct
numbers on teletext, which were different from those aired by ZDF.</p>

<p>"But Franz believed we were winners until the next morning. When I told him the
truth, he was devastated," Coenen added.</p>
