        <h1>PILLARS</h1>
        <p>
          The CREATE H2O program includes five pillars offering in-depth
          training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within each of these pillars, there are many options from which
          students may choose. For each student accepted into the program, the
          pillar requirements are tailored to the student's educational
          background, degree course requirements, and the focus area the student
          wishes to pursue in First Nations water and sanitation security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each student accepted into the program is assigned two professors who
          will act as mentors. Along with the CREATE H2O program co- ordinator,
          these professors will assist students in designing the pillar
          structure and activities that best match each student's career path
          and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students accepted into the program will receive financial support
          consisting of a <a href="#">stipend</a> and
          <a href="#">travel</a> awards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Undergraduate students must choose between a relevant research-based
          project (Pillar 1) and a professional work term (Pillar 5). In
          addition, undergraduate students are required to complete 8 portfolio
          units across at least two of the other three program pillars before
          you graduate.

          Note that these are general examples. Each student's background will
          be assessed by supervisors at the start of the program to design a
          specific set of unit requirements that will complement the student's
          strengths.
