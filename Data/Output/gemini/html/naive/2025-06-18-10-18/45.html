                <p class="post-date">Wednesday, November 26, 2014</p>
                
                <p>A lottery player from MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany, had his hopes raised for nothing
                    last week when a German TV station broadcast the wrong numbers and caused to
                    believe he'd snagged a big win when he had not.</p>

                <p>When Franz Engelen, 58, tuned into ZDF on Wednesday, November 19, the onscreen
                    numbers were a perfect match for the six numbers chosen by his lottery syndicate so
                    he thought they'd won the jackpot. His share of the money would have been
                    â¬950,000.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately for Engelen, ZDF had broadcast the previous week's numbers by
                    mistake so his celebrations were all for naught.</p>

                <p>Speaking to the German tabloid <i>Bild</i>, Engelen said: "I was on the go; I looked quickly
                    at the draw, wrote down the numbers and turned off the TV. When I compared the
                    numbers with a lottery ticket and saw that six match I could not believe my luck."</p>

                <p>Totally fooled by the televised numbers, Engelen and his wife never thought to
                    contact the lottery to ask for confirmation. They began making plans instead and
                    were even considering buying their daughter a condo.</p>

                <p>Engelen learned the unfortunate truth the following morning when fellow syndicate
                    member Tipper Reinhard Coenen, 52, told him they'd won not a cent.</p>

                <p>"I knew that we had not won," Coenen said, recalling he had seen the numbers on
                    teletext and they were not the same as those broadcast by ZDF.</p>

                <p>"But Franz felt until the next morning that we were victorious. When he learned it
                    from me, he was devastated," Coenen added.</p>
