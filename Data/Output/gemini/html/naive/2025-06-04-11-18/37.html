        <h1>Rome to Take Over Entire Earth</h1>
        <h2>"The War for Earth's Kingdom"</h2>

        <p>In '90 a profound volume appeared, authored by the Vatican's inside person, Malachi Martin. Martin had very remarkable qualifications. On the
        cover of his other book, the following description showed up:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>"Malachi Martin was a diplomat, spy of three popes, a master of seventeen languages, an expert on the Bible and
            instructor at Rome's Biblical Academy. He participated in translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&#x2014;Breakdown of the
            Catholic Society.</p>
        </div>

        <p>What other group takes part in undercover activity? Wouldn't that be best for Catholic leaders if the Vatican never involved itself in spying?</p>

        <p>The long book that draws concern by Martin is titled <strong><em>The Keys of This Blood: The War for Earth's Kingdom Between Pope John Paul, Mikhail
        Gorbachev & the Capitalist West</em></strong> (bold type). Amazing, huh? The front boldly shares John Paul will dominate globally, the content purports his
        detailed schemes to fulfill this.</p>

        <p>The cover of Martin's volume refers to John Paul's ventures "the war for earthly dominion." E. White used to call the papacy's initiatives "a
        deep and active struggle to seize influence worldwide." A sort of overlap, right?</p>

        <p>Yet E. White's foretelling doesn't end with just that the papacy would grow stronger, but it will trigger once more to oppress. Observe the
        quoted material taken from <em>The Keys of This Blood:</em></p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>In [the] viewpoints [of "Seventh-Day Adventists, Baptists and religious groups"], the value & honor for democratic thinking
            places on them responsibility&#x2014;the religious, also the civic and the legal obligation&#x2014;to shield people's right to disagree. Every
            person should possess the right to not just accept the idea of hell for the wicked and heaven for the chosen. Every person will
            get the right to pick hell instead of heaven. This responsibility sent far enough puts Minor people separate from John Paul; it
            sets one against the Holy See, too.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That creates separation from the Holy See, simply because democratic thinking shall never dominate holy writing. No individual
        is ever compelled to be convinced about heaven or hell, nor select the specific one. Still, it is true for John Paul no individual
        holds the right&#x2014;democratic and otherwise&#x2014;to a moral transgression;....-p. 287.</p>

        <p>Martin says freedom as a choice is excessive, and states groups that suggest a choice are "against" John Paul. Stated differently, Martin
        claims that, similar to the former popes, right now the papacy does not consider freedom as a choice, and might not grant that as a role in the
        future world structure they seek.</p>

        <p>Who has authority to identify "wrong behaviors"? Rome has the answer: "The pope." Now, since a person shouldn't commit wrong actions, if
        the Pope figures what's right and wrong, would just anything block a rebirth of the persecution if the Papal Leaders claim the power that was
        lost?</p>
