        <h1>Export news from google sites</h1>
        <p class="date" style="color: #555;">Apr 27, 2012<br>1 minute read</p>

        <p>I've added a script, <a href="#">export_google_site_news</a>, to my catchall repository on github.</p>

        <p>For example, to download the news stories at
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements">https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements</a>, you
            would run
        </p>

        <pre>
export_google_site_news https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements
        </pre>

        <h2>The backstory</h2>
        <p>When Free It Athens moved our website from Google Sites to Drupal, we started from
            scratch rather than importing our old content. I realized on Wednesday that the news
            posts on the site were interesting historical information, yet I'd never archived them.</p>

        <p>First, I tried a recursive wget.</p>

        <pre>
wget -r --no-parent --no-clobber ...
        </pre>

        <p>This failed to work because Google pointlessly used javascript rather than anchor tags
            to link between the news listing pages.</p>

        <p>Next I found and tried to use the google-sites-export tool from Google's Data
            Liberation Team, but I was never able to authenticate succesfully from it.</p>

        <p>At this point I was worried I'd need to use a tool like Selenium to run the javascript,
            but then I realized the news listing pages took a single paramater to determine how
            far along in the pagination they were. It wouldn't take more than a C-style for loop to
            download them all.</p>

        <pre>
for i in $(seq 0 10 120); do
wget "" "-Onews.$i"
done
        </pre>

        <p>After doing that, I looked at the first one and determined a pattern that would match
            the relative URLs of individual news stories. I then extracted all the URLS.</p>

        <pre>
grep -E -h -o '/a/freeitathens.org/foo/news/[a-z0-9\-]+' news.* |
sort -u > news_links
        </pre>

        <p>Once I had the list of URLs, it was simple to have wget download them all.</p>

        <pre>
wget -i news_links -B https://sites.google.com
        </pre>

        <p>Since I didn't find any other guides to doing this, I decided to flesh out what I'd done
            into a simple tool and write about it here.</p>
