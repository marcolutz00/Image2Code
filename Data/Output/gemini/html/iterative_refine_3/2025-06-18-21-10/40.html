            <p>Monitors of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine registered a record number of ceasefire violations in Ukraine's Donetsk region on Thursday since the sides
                agreed on a ceasefire in September 2015, Ertugrul Apakan, the chief monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, said in a statement posted on the

                over the past 24 hours, It was reported by the local Donetsk News Agency (DNA) on Thursday.</p>
            <p>"Over the past 24 hours the Ukrainian army has shelled the republic's territory 327 times. The situation in the DPR remains tense," the source said.</p>
            <p>The DPR ministry added that the Ukrainian army had launched 123 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells at the republic's populated localities and had also used infantry
                combat vehicles, various types of grenade launchers and small arms.</p>

                airport and the Volvo-Center in the northern part of Donetsk as well as the Kominternovo and Bezymennoye villages in the south of the DPR came under most intensive
                shelling that involved the use of weapons banned by the Minsk agreements.</p>
