        <p class="date">1 minute read</p>

        <p>I've added a script, <a href="#">export_google_site_news</a>, to my catchall repository on github.</p>

        <p>For example, to download the news stories at
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements">https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements</a>, you
        would run</p>

        <pre><code>export_google_site_news https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www announcements</code></pre>

        <h2>The backstory</h2>
        <p>When Free It Athens moved our website from Google Sites to Drupal, we started from
        scratch rather than importing our old content. I realized on Wednesday that the news
        posts on the site were interesting historical information, yet I'd never archived them.</p>

        <p>First, I tried a recursive wget.</p>

        <pre><code>wget -r --no-parent --no-clobber ...</code></pre>

        <p>This failed to work because Google pointlessly used javascript rather than anchor tags
        to link between the news listing pages.</p>

        <p>Next I found and tried to use the google-sites-export tool from Google's Data
        Liberation Team, but I was never able to authenticate succesfully from it.</p>

        <p>At this point I was worried I'd need to use a tool like Selenium to run the javascript,
        but then I realized the news listing pages took a single paramater to determine how
        far along in the pagination they were. It wouldn't take more than a C-style for loop to
        download them all.</p>

        <pre><code>for i in $(seq 0 10 120); do
  wget ""   "-Onews.$i"
done</code></pre>

        <p>After doing that, I looked at the first one and determined a pattern that would match
        the relative URLs of individual news stories. I then extracted all the URLS.</p>

        <pre><code>grep -E -h -o '/a/freeitathens.org/foo/news/[a-z0-9\-]+' news.* |
sort -u > news_links</code></pre>

        <p>Once I had the list of URLs, it was simple to have wget download them all.</p>

        <pre><code>wget -i news_links -B https://sites.google.com</code></pre>

        <p>Since I didn't find any other guides to doing this, I decided to flesh out what I'd done
        into a simple tool and write about it here.</p>
