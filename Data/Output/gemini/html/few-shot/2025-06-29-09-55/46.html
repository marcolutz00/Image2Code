            <div class="verse">"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." John 17:17</div>
            <article>
                <p>When the gospel comes "not in word only, but also in power," it comes "in the Holy Ghost," that is, in and with the
                    teaching and testimony of the Holy Ghost. It is this coming "in
                    the Holy Ghost" which gives truth in its power such a sanctifying influence on the heart. But you will ask, perhaps, What is a
                    sanctifying influence? It is the communication of holy
                    feelings, heavenly desires, and gracious affections; in a word, it is the breathing into the soul of that sweet spirituality of mind
                    which is life and peace. If we are among the people of
                    God, he chose us in Christ "before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." If
                    he chasten us in this time-state, it is "for our profit,
                    that we might be partakers of his holiness" (Heb. 12:10). It is this holiness of heart, this heavenly-mindedness which I mean when I
                    speak of the sanctifying influence of truth in its
                    power. Now did truth ever come into your soul with any measure of this sanctifying influence? Did you ever long to get away from
                    the chapel, go home to your room, fall upon
                    your knees, and have blessed fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ? And were you ever so favoured when you did get
                    home? Or sometimes when alone, in reading, or
                    meditation, or secret prayer, did the word of God ever come into your soul with that sweet unction, savour, and dew that it seemed
                    to make the very room in which you were holy
                    ground? I remember when God was pleased to reveal his dear Son to my soul in my sick room many years ago, I was afraid almost to
                    go out of my room lest I should lose the
                    sweet, holy feelings and blessed spirituality of mind which I then and there enjoyed. Depend upon it, there is a holiness of heart
                    and affection, an inward holiness, without which no
                    man shall see the Lord; and depend upon it, whenever truth comes into a believer's soul, it comes with that sanctifying
                    influence, which not only gives him a meetness for, but is a
                    blessed foretaste of the inheritance of the saints in light.
