        <h1>Export news from google sites</h1>

        <p class="date">Apr 27, 2012<br>
            1 minute read</p>

        <p>I've added a script, <a href="#">export_google_site_news</a>, to my catchall repository on github.</p>

        <p>For example, to download the news stories at
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements">https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www/announcements</a>, you would run</p>

        <pre><code>export_google_site_news https://sites.google.com/a/medinacommunityband.org/www announcements</code></pre>

        <h2>The backstory</h2>

        <p>When Free It Athens moved our website from Google Sites to Drupal, we started from scratch rather than importing our old content. I realized on Wednesday that the news posts on the site were interesting historical information, yet I'd never archived them.</p>

        <p>First, I tried a recursive wget.</p>

        <pre><code>wget -r --no-parent --no-clobber ...</code></pre>

        <p>This failed to work because Google pointlessly used javascript rather than anchor tags to link between the news listing pages.</p>

        <p>Next I found and tried to use the google-sites-export tool from Google's Data Liberation Team, but I was never able to authenticate succesfully from it.</p>

        <p>At this point I was worried I'd need to use a tool like Selenium to run the javascript, but then I realized the news listing pages took a single paramater to determine how far along in the pagination they were. It wouldn't take more than a C-style for loop to download them all.</p>

        <pre><code>for i in $(seq 0 10 120); do
  wget ""   "-Onews.$i"
done</code></pre>

        <p>After doing that, I looked at the first one and determined a pattern that would match the relative URLs of individual news stories. I then extracted all the URLS.</p>

        <pre><code>grep -E -h -o '/a/freeitathens.org/foo/news/[a-z0-9-]+' news.* |
sort -u > news_links</code></pre>

        <p>Once I had the list of URLs, it was simple to have wget download them all.</p>

        <pre><code>wget -i news_links -B https://sites.google.com</code></pre>

        <p>Since I didn't find any other guides to doing this, I decided to flesh out what I'd done into a simple tool and write about it here.</p>
