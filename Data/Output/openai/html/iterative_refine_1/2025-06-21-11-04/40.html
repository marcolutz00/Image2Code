        <div class="content">
            Monitors of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine registered a record number of ceasefire violations in Ukraine's Donetsk region on Thursday since the sides agreed on a ceasefire in September 2015, Ertugrul Apakan, the chief monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, said in a statement posted on the OSCE website. He said the sides (in the Ukrainian conflict) had created an unacceptable situation on the line of contact.
            
            According to a source at the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic's defense ministry, the Ukrainian army has shelled the territory of the DPR along the line of contact 327 times over the past 24 hours, It was reported by the local Donetsk News Agency (DAN) on Thursday.
            
            "Over the past 24 hours the Ukrainian army has shelled the republic's territory 327 times. The situation in the DPR remains tense," the source said.
            
            The DPR ministry added that the Ukrainian army had launched 123 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells at the republic's populated localities and had also used infantry combat vehicles, various types of grenade launchers and small arms.
