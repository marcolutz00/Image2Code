                <p>She looked at the man walking along the <span class="image-placeholder"></span> next to the nice houses. He didn't live <span class="image-placeholder"></span> any of those houses. She had seen this <span class="image-placeholder"></span> several times before. He looked like a criminal. <span class="image-placeholder"></span> knew not to judge a book by its <span class="image-placeholder"></span>, but this man was no good. She drove <span class="image-placeholder"></span> him. He looked at her car as she <span class="image-placeholder"></span> by. She continued driving. She watched him in <span class="image-placeholder"></span> rear view mirror. She got to the corner <span class="image-placeholder"></span> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <span class="image-placeholder"></span> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway. <span class="image-placeholder"></span> red SUV was parked in the driveway right <span class="image-placeholder"></span> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <span class="image-placeholder"></span> the driverâs door and put his hand on <span class="image-placeholder"></span> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <span class="image-placeholder"></span> in her direction. What was that all about, <span class="image-placeholder"></span> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested <span class="image-placeholder"></span> door to see if it was locked. He <span class="image-placeholder"></span> a criminal, she thought. That's what he does. <span class="image-placeholder"></span> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <span class="image-placeholder"></span> break into. She called the police. She described <span class="image-placeholder"></span>. The officer said he knew who the man <span class="image-placeholder"></span>. Residents called two or three times a week <span class="image-placeholder"></span> report him walking by. But the police couldn't <span class="image-placeholder"></span> him for walking around. They had to catch <span class="image-placeholder"></span> with stolen goods. "But he was testing that <span class="image-placeholder"></span> door to see if it was unlocked," she <span class="image-placeholder"></span> "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <span class="image-placeholder"></span> law. If you see him actually steal something, <span class="image-placeholder"></span> us a call." </p>
