                    She looked at the man walking along the <div></div> next to the nice houses. He didnÃÂ¢ÃÃt live
                    <div></div> any of those houses. She had seen this <div></div> several times before. He
                    looked like a criminal. <div></div> knew not to judge a book by its <div></div>, but this man
                    was no good. She drove <div></div> him. He looked at her car as she <div></div> by. She
                    continued driving. She watched him in <div></div> rear view mirror. She got to the corner
                    <div></div> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <div></div> direction. Suddenly,
                    he turned left up a driveway. <div></div> red SUV was parked in the driveway right
                    <div></div> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <div></div> the driver's door and put his
                    hand on <div></div> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <div></div> in her
                    direction. What was that all about, <div></div> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested
                    <div></div> door to see if it was locked. He <div></div> a criminal, she thought. ThatÃÂ¢ÃÃs what
                    he does. <div></div> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <div></div> break
                    into. She called the police. She described <div></div>. The officer said he knew who the man
                    <div></div> Residents called two or three times a week <div></div> report him walking by. But
                    the police couldnÃÂ¢ÃÃt <div></div> him for walking around. They had to catch <div></div> with
                    stolen goods. ÃÂ¢ÃÃBut he was testing that <div></div> door to see if it was unlocked,ÃÂ¢ÃÃ she
                    <div></div>. ÃÂ¢ÃÃIÃÂ¢ÃÃm sorry,ÃÂ¢ÃÃ said the officer. ÃÂ¢ÃÃThatÃÂ¢ÃÃs not against <div></div> law. If you see him
                    actually steal something, <div></div> us a call.ÃÂ¢ÃÃ
