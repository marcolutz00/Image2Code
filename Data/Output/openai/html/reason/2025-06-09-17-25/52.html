                She glanced at the guy walking down the <span class="text-input"></span> by the fancy homes. He didn't stay <span class="text-input"></span> any of those homes. She had noticed this <span class="text-input"></span> several times before. He looked like a thief. <span class="text-input"></span> knew not to judge a book by its <span class="text-input"></span>, but this guy was trouble. She steered <span class="text-input"></span> him. He eyed her car as she <span class="text-input"></span> by. She drove onward. She kept watching him in <span class="text-input"></span> the rearview mirror. She got to the junction <span class="text-input"></span> halted. She still eyed him strolling in <span class="text-input"></span> direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a lane. <span class="text-input"></span> bright red SUV was in the driveway right <span class="text-input"></span> to the walkway. She saw him go up <span class="text-input"></span> the driver's side and touched <span class="text-input"></span> handle. He went to the sidewalk and carried <span class="text-input"></span> in her direction. What was that all about, she <span class="text-input"></span> wondered. Then she knew he had checked <span class="text-input"></span> the door to see if it was open. He's <span class="text-input"></span> a crook, she thought. That's his work. <span class="text-input"></span> just goes through areas searching for cars <span class="text-input"></span> to rob. She telephoned the police. She described <span class="text-input"></span>. The cop said he knew the man <span class="text-input"></span>. People called a couple of times a week <span class="text-input"></span>, saying he was nearby. But the cops couldn't <span class="text-input"></span> him just for being there. They had to nab <span class="text-input"></span> him with stolen stuff. "But he tried that <span class="text-input"></span> door to see if it was unlocked," she <span class="text-input"></span>. "I'm sorry," the cop said. "That's not against <span class="text-input"></span> the rules. If you catch him stealing, give <span class="text-input"></span> us a ring."
