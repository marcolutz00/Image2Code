        <h2>"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." John 17:17</h2>
        <p>When the gospel comes "not in word only, but also in power," it comes "in the Holy Ghost," that is, in and with the 
            teaching and testimony of the Holy Ghost. It is this coming "in the Holy Ghost" which gives truth in its power such 
            a sanctifying influence on the heart. But you will ask, perhaps, What is a sanctifying influence? It is the 
            communication of holy feelings, heavenly desires, and gracious affections; in a word, it is the breathing into the 
            soul of that sweet spirituality of mind which is life and peace. If we are among the people of God, he chose us in 
            Christ "before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." If he 
            chasten us in this time-state, it is "for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness" (Heb. 12:10). 
            It is this holiness of heart, this heavenly-mindedness which I mean when I speak of the sanctifying influence of 
            truth in its power. Now did truth ever come into your soul with any measure of this sanctifying influence? Did you 
            ever long to get away from the chapel, go home to your room, fall upon your knees, and have blessed fellowship with 
            the Father and his Son Jesus Christ? And were you ever so favoured when you did get home? Or sometimes when alone, 
            in reading, or meditation, or secret prayer, did the word of God ever come into your soul with that sweet unction, 
            savour, and dew that it seemed to make the very room in which you were holy ground? I remember when God was pleased 
            to reveal his dear Son to my soul in my sick room many years ago, I was afraid almost to go out of my room lest I 
            should lose the sweet, holy feelings and blessed spirituality of mind which I then and there enjoyed. Depend upon 
            it, there is a holiness of heart and affection, an inward holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord; and 
            depend upon it, whenever truth comes into a believer's soul, it comes with that sanctifying influence, which not 
            only gives him a meetness for, but is a blessed foretaste of the inheritance of the saints in light.</p>
