            She looked at the man walking along the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> any of those houses. She had seen this <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">
            several times before. He looked like a criminal. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> knew not to judge a book by its 
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">, but this man was no good. She drove <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> him. 
            He looked at her car as she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> by. She continued driving. She watched him in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">
            rear view mirror. She got to the corner <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">
            direction. Suddenly, he turned left up a driveway. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right 
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up to <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> the driver's door and put his hand
            on <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> in her direction. 
            What was that all about, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> door to see if it was locked. He <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> a criminal, she thought. That's what
            he does. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> break
            into. She called the police. She described <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">. The officer said he knew who the man
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">. Residents called two or three times a week <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> report him walking by. But
            the police couldn't <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> him for walking around. They had to catch <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> with
            stolen goods. "But he was testing that <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> door to see if it was unlocked," she 
            <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> law. If you see him 
            actually steal something, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder"> us a call."
