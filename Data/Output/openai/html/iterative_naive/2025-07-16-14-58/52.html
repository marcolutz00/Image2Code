            <p>She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text"> next to the nice houses. He didnât live</p>
            <p>in <input type="text"> any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text"> several times before. He</p>
            <p>looked like a criminal. <input type="text"> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text">, but this man</p>
            <p>was no good. She drove <input type="text"> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text"> by. She</p>
            <p>continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner</p>
            <p>stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text"> direction. Suddenly,</p>
            <p>he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right</p>
            <p><input type="text"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text"> the driver's door and put his</p>
            <p>hand on <input type="text"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text"> in her</p>
            <p>direction. What was that all about, <input type="text"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested</p>
            <p>door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text"> a criminal, she thought. That's what</p>
            <p>he does. <input type="text"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text"> break</p>
            <p>into. She called the police. She described <input type="text">. The officer said he knew who the man</p>
            <p><input type="text">. Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text"> report him walking by. But</p>
            <p>the police couldnât <input type="text"> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text"> with</p>
            <p>stolen goods. âBut he was testing that <input type="text"> door to see if it was unlocked,â she</p>
            <p>âI'm sorry,â said the officer. âThat's not against <input type="text"> law. If you see him</p>
            <p>actually steal something, <input type="text"> us a call.â</p>
