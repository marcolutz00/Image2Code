                She looked at the man walking along the <input type="text" placeholder="..."> next to the nice houses. He didn't live 
                <input type="text" placeholder="..."> any of those houses. She had seen this <input type="text" placeholder="..."> several times before. He 
                looked like a criminal. <input type="text" placeholder="..."> knew not to judge a book by its <input type="text" placeholder="...">, but this man 
                was no good. She drove <input type="text" placeholder="..."> him. He looked at her car as she <input type="text" placeholder="..."> by. She 
                continued driving. She watched him in <input type="text" placeholder="..."> rear view mirror. She got to the corner 
                <input type="text" placeholder="..."> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <input type="text" placeholder="..."> direction. Suddenly, 
                he turned left up a driveway. <input type="text" placeholder="..."> red SUV was parked in the driveway right 
                <input type="text" placeholder="..."> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <input type="text" placeholder="..."> the driver's door and put his 
                hand on <input type="text" placeholder="..."> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <input type="text" placeholder="..."> in her 
                direction. What was that all about, <input type="text" placeholder="..."> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested 
                <input type="text" placeholder="..."> door to see if it was locked. He <input type="text" placeholder="..."> a criminal, she thought. That's what 
                he does. <input type="text" placeholder="..."> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <input type="text" placeholder="..."> break 
                into. She called the police. She described <input type="text" placeholder="...">. The officer said he knew who the man 
                <input type="text" placeholder="...">. Residents called two or three times a week <input type="text" placeholder="..."> report him walking by. But 
                the police couldn't <input type="text" placeholder="..."> him for walking around. They had to catch <input type="text" placeholder="..."> with 
                stolen goods. "But he was testing that <input type="text" placeholder="..."> door to see if it was unlocked," she 
                <input type="text" placeholder="...">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <input type="text" placeholder="..."> law. If you see him 
                actually steal something, <input type="text" placeholder="..."> us a call."
