                <p>The Round Lake Area Exchange Club Hometown Hero Committee is honored to announce U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Alejandro Macias as the May hero. This monthÃ¢â¬â¢s sponsor is Collision Solution located in Hainesville.</p>
                <p>Macias was registered at the Clubs site, www.rlaexchange.org/hero, by his very proud mother, Victoria L. Macias. The May hero, a Round Lake Park resident, graduated in 2010 from Round Lake Senior High School.</p>
                <p>Ã¢â¬ÅAlejandro is our ninth hero being honored and we along with his family are in awe of his service to country and joining during the time of war.Ã¢â¬Â shared Sherry Ridge, the Hometown Hero Project Chair. Macias is currently in Jacksonville, NC. He just graduated from V-22 Airframes Mechanics School. Ã¢â¬ÅI always get chills and tears of pride when I speak with the family members of our heroesÃ¢â¬Â said Ridge. His mother also shared that he earned an expert rifleman award.</p>
                <p>The Lance CorporalÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬ÅHanging with the HeroesÃ¢â¬Â care package will be filled with chips, fruit, lots of chocolate along with a personalized Ã¢â¬ÅHanging with the HeroesÃ¢â¬Â T-shirt and letters from Round Lake Area School District 116 students. A requested item of a Ã¢â¬ÅBlack Chicago skyline baseball capÃ¢â¬Â has been made, Ridge is working on finding this cap.</p>
                <p>The Club will present a plaque on behalf of the May Hometown Hero to his family at their meeting on May 25. The meeting is held at Panera Bread in Round Lake Beach, 7:30 a.m.</p>
