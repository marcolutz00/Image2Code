                She looked at the man walking along the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> next to the nice houses. He didnât live 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="90" height="15"> any of those houses. She had seen this 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="140" height="15"> several times before. He 
                looked like a criminal. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> knew not to judge a book by its 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="90" height="15"> , but this man
                was no good. She drove <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> him. He looked at her car as she 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> by. She 
                continued driving. She watched him in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> direction. Suddenly, 
                he turned left up a driveway. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="50" height="15"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="150" height="15"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="150" height="15"> the driverâs door and put his 
                hand on <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="50" height="15"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="120" height="15"> in her 
                direction. What was that all about, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="80" height="15"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested 
                the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="150" height="15"> door to see if it was locked. He 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="70" height="15"> a criminal, she thought. Thatâs what 
                he does. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="90" height="15"> break 
                into. She called the police. She described <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> . The officer said he knew who the man 
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="80" height="15"> . Residents called two or three times a week <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="100" height="15"> report him walking by. But 
                the police couldnât <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> him for walking around. They had to catch <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="120" height="15"> with 
                stolen goods. âBut he was testing that <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="160" height="15"> door to see if it was unlocked,â she
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="80" height="15"> . âIâm sorry,â said the officer. âThatâs not against <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="60" height="15"> law. If you see him 
                actually steal something, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt=" " width="140" height="15"> us a call.â
