        <h2>How to Upload Videos to YouTube if Access to Website is Blocked</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="content">
        <p class="post-meta">July 25, 2007</p>
        <p><strong>R</strong>ichard, who works for a large Fortune 100 company, <a href="#">recently wrote on Facebook</a> that he cannot upload screencast video clips to YouTube since the company he works for has blocked access to YouTube and other video sharing websites though the firewall.</p>
        <p>One of the available options is to use your <a href="#">mobile phone</a> for uploading videos on YouTube - just create a mobile profile on YouTube from a computer outside the organization's firewall and then email the video to YouTube as an MMS message.</p>
        <p>Related: <a href="#">How to Access Blocked Websites</a></p>
        <p>The second more versatile option is the one-to-many <a href="#">Hey!Spread</a> - this is an online service to help you upload a video clip to multiple video sharing websites in one go.</p>
        <p>You upload the video to Hey!Spread servers and they in turn upload it to the various other video sites including YouTube, MySpace, PhotoBucket, MetaCafe, Google, Yahoo! video, DailyMotion, etc.</p>
        <p>Chances are high that access to Hey!Spread is open in your company - they'll send you an email confirmation as soon as your video is uploaded successfully to the different sites.</p>

            <p>Facebook users are not too pleased with the "walled garden" approach of Facebook. The reason is simple - while you can easily import your Outlook address book and GMail contacts into Facebook, the reverse path is closed.</p>

            <p>Almost every blog has a site search form where you just type in the search query and press enter to digg through the archives of that blog . The only drawback here is that you first have to visit the site homepage to locate the search box.</p>
