                She looked at the man walking along the <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="70" height="20"> next to the nice houses. He didn't live
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> any of those houses. She had seen this <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="90" height="20"> several times before. He
                looked like a criminal. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> knew not to judge a book by its <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100" height="20">, but this man
                was no good. She drove <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="60" height="20"> him. He looked at her car as she <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="30" height="20"> by. She
                continued driving. She watched him in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100" height="20"> rear view mirror. She got to the corner
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> stopped. She continued to watch him walking in <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="80" height="20"> direction. Suddenly,
                he turned left up a driveway. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> red SUV was parked in the driveway right
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> to the sidewalk. She saw him walk up <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100" height="20"> the driver's door and put his
                hand on <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> handle. He returned to the sidewalk and continued <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="80" height="20"> in her
                direction. What was that all about, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100" height="20"> wondered. Then she realized that he had tested
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="80" height="20"> door to see if it was locked. He <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> a criminal, she thought. That's what
                he does. <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="70" height="20"> just walks through our neighborhoods looking for cars <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="60" height="20"> break
                into. She called the police. She described <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="130" height="20">. The officer said he knew who the man
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="60" height="20">. Residents called two or three times a week <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="90" height="20"> report him walking by. But
                the police couldnâ€™t <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> him for walking around. They had to catch <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> with
                stolen goods. "But he was testing that <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="60" height="20"> door to see if it was unlocked," she
                <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="80" height="20">. "I'm sorry," said the officer. "That's not against <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="70" height="20"> law. If you see him
                actually steal something, <img src="src/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="50" height="20"> us a call."
