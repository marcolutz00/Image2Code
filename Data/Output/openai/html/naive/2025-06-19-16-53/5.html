        <h2>How to Upload Videos to YouTube if Access to Website is Blocked</h2>

                ichard, who works for a large Fortune 100 company, <a href="#">recently wrote on Facebook</a> that he cannot upload screencast video clips to YouTube since the company he works for has blocked access to YouTube and other video sharing websites though the firewall.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the available options is to use your <a href="#">mobile phone</a> for uploading videos on YouTube - just create a mobile profile on YouTube from a computer outside the organization's firewall and then email the video to YouTube as an MMS message.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second more versatile option is the one-to-many <a href="#">Hey!Spread</a> - this is an online service to help you upload a video clip to multiple video sharing websites in one go.
            </p>
            <p>
                You upload the video to Hey!Spread servers and they in turn upload it to the various other video sites including YouTube, MySpace, PhotoBucket, MetaCafe, Google, Yahoo! video, DailyMotion, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chances are high that access to Hey!Spread is open in your company - they'll send you an email confirmation as soon as your video is uploaded successfully to the different sites.

                <p>October 15, 2007</p>
                <p>
                    Facebook users are not too pleased with the "walled garden" approach of Facebook. The reason is simple - while you can easily import your Outlook address book and GMail contacts into Facebook, the reverse path is closed.

                    Almost every blog has a site search form where you just type in the search query and press enter to digg through the archives of that blog . The only drawback here is that you first have to visit the site homepage to locate the search box.
